- better shuffle mechanism
  - when u shuffle, the song selected/playing should become first and the rest shuffled
    (not really, i prefer how it is now)
  - when no shuffle, the song selected/playing should go to his original position
  - play next song should always play the next song showed in the playing songs listview
- you should not use internet to load songs!!!!
- fix the green background on selected cell so text is readable, may also look for the red color on black
  (nah, it's ok)
- the app should remember its last status whenever it launches:
  - save shuffle/repeat options

# TODO
- should load playlists/songs when launching app
- should add a sync button
- find music
- the app should remember its last status whenever it launches:
  - save shuffle/repeat options
- the app should remember its last status whenever it launches:

  - pause/play song = space
  - repeat
  - shuffle
- media keys not working when creating the app manually (using main.swift)
  I solved this by actually using a Xib file because i couldn't make it work without it

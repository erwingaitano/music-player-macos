- better shuffle mechanism
  - when u shuffle, the song selected/playing should become first and the rest shuffled
    (not really, i prefer how it is now)
  - when no shuffle, the song selected/playing should go to his original position
  - play next song should always play the next song showed in the playing songs listview
- you should not use internet to load songs!!!!
- fix the green background on selected cell so text is readable, may also look for the red color on black
  (nah, it's ok)
- the app should remember its last status whenever it launches:
  - save shuffle/repeat options
- fix the player cover
- the app should remember the volume last status
- when u double click on a song in the middle table, it should populate the playing list with those songs
- do notifications
- add an app icon

  I solved this by actually using a Xib file because i couldn't make it work without it
